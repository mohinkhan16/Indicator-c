📘 C Programming Practice Programs
Overview

This repository contains C programming practice programs written to strengthen core concepts such as arrays, pointers, functions, loops, and string handling. Each program is simple, well-structured, and suitable for beginners as well as students preparing for exams or interviews.

The focus of these programs is on logic building and understanding internal working of C, rather than using built-in shortcuts.

🧩 Programs Included:-

1️⃣ Cube of Elements Using 2D Array & Function:

This program:

Accepts a square 2D array from the user

Uses a function with pointer to a 2D array

Calculates and prints the cube of each element

🔹 Concepts Used :-

2D Arrays

Pointer to Array

Functions

2️⃣String Length Calculation Without strlen()

This program:-

Takes a string input from the user

Uses a character pointer to traverse the string

Calculates string length without using built-in functions

🔹 Concepts Used:-

Strings in C

Character Pointers

fgets() for safe input

Pointer Traversal

🔹 Sample Output:-

Nested Loops

User Input / Output

🔹 Sample Output:-

Cubes of all elements:-
1 8 27
64 125 216

🎯Purpose of This Repository:-

Practice core C programming concepts

Improve understanding of arrays and pointers

Learn how things work internally without library functions
